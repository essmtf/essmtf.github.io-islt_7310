     Hi Everyone! I live in St. Louis, Missouri. I was born and raised here.  I went to St. Louis University and got a BA in political science.  I moved to Omaha Nebraska to attend law school and then practiced law for about 20 years.  About 10 years ago, I moved back to Missouri to be closer to my family and attend MIZZOU.
I have a small farm in Moberly, Missouri. Recently, my dad died and my mom suffered a stroke. I am caring for her while she recovers. While I am at my momâ€™s, a friend is looking after my farm.   COVID-19 has impacted my stay indefinitely. 
I enjoy learning new things.  I have limited knowledge of web application/development.  I hope to learn web skills by taking this course. I love spending time with family and friends. Walking my dogs and watching the sunset are some of my favorite activities.
